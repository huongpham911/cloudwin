This is a backup of the working CreateVPS.tsx component that successfully:

- ✅ Loads regions from `/api/v1/regions`
- ✅ Loads sizes from `/api/v1/sizes`  
- ✅ Loads images from `/api/v1/images`
- ✅ Uses correct data parsing: `response.regions` instead of `response.data.regions`
- ✅ Works with React Query properly
- ✅ Renders dropdowns correctly
